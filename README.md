# SQL-Programming-Assignement

## Description

This repository contains my SQL programming assignment for the Create and Manage Databases course at HEC Montreal. The assignment involves writing SQL queries to analyze a given dataset. The goal of this project was to create a database to help a company operating in the field of connected objects (IoT) to launch its latest product: the LiveMiniBar.

The LiveMiniBar is designed for hotels that want to offer a selection of drinks and consumable products in their guests' rooms. Adhering to the common characteristics of an Internet of Things (IoT) device, the LiveMiniBar "knows" its inventory at all times and can provide this information as it connects to the network. Through a mechanism of reliable sensors (weight, size), the LiveMiniBar has the capability to identify in real-time the products placed or removed from its own shelves.


The task at hand was to design a database that will allow hotel employees to fill the LiveMiniBar and for clients to consume the products it contains and answer questions and scenarios related to the use of the LiveMiniBar and the database.
